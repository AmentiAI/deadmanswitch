       question: "What is a Dead Man's Switch?",
       answer: "A Dead Man's Switch is like a time capsule for your Bitcoin, but instead of opening in 10 years, it opens when you're probably dead. It's the ultimate 'I'll deal with this later' solution, except 'later' is 99 years from now.",
       category: "General"
     },
    {
      question: "How does the 99-year lock work?",
      answer: "The lock uses Bitcoin's nLockTime field, which prevents a transaction from being included in a block until a specific block height is reached. We calculate this as current block height + (99 years Ã— 6 blocks per hour Ã— 24 hours Ã— 365 days).",
      category: "Technical"
    },
    {
      question: "Is my Bitcoin safe during the lock period?",
      answer: "Yes, your Bitcoin remains completely secure. The funds stay in your control until the timelock expires. We use Bitcoin's consensus rules and cryptographic security - no third-party custody is involved.",
      category: "Security"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I lose my PSBT?",
      answer: "If you lose your PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction), you may not be able to unlock your funds when the timelock expires. It's crucial to store your PSBT securely, preferably in multiple secure locations.",
      category: "Security"
    },
         {
       question: "Can I unlock my funds before 99 years?",
       answer: "Nope! That's the whole point. Once you lock it, it's locked until 99 years from now. Think of it as the ultimate commitment device. No take-backsies, no 'I changed my mind' - just pure, unbreakable regret.",
       category: "Technical"
     },
    {
      question: "What fees are involved?",
      answer: "You'll need to pay standard Bitcoin network fees for the initial locking transaction. The fee amount depends on network congestion and transaction size. We recommend setting aside 0.0001 BTC for fees.",
      category: "Fees"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I lock multiple UTXOs?",
      answer: "Yes, you can lock multiple UTXOs in a single transaction. This can be more cost-effective than locking them separately. The system will calculate the optimal way to combine your UTXOs.",
      category: "Technical"
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after 99 years?",
      answer: "After the timelock expires, anyone with the correct unlocking script can spend the UTXO. You should ensure your heirs or beneficiaries have access to the necessary information to claim the funds.",
      category: "General"
    },
    {
      question: "Is this service free to use?",
      answer: "The Dead Man's Switch service is free to use. You only pay standard Bitcoin network fees for your transactions. We believe in making Bitcoin security accessible to everyone.",
      category: "Fees"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this with hardware wallets?",
      answer: "Yes, our system is compatible with all Bitcoin wallets that support PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions), including popular hardware wallets like Ledger, Trezor, and others.",
      category: "Technical"
    },
    {
      question: "What if Bitcoin's consensus rules change?",
      answer: "Bitcoin's consensus rules are designed to be extremely difficult to change. The nLockTime feature has been part of Bitcoin since its inception and is considered one of the most stable and secure features.",
      category: "Technical"
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get help if something goes wrong?",
      answer: "We provide comprehensive documentation, a support team, and community forums. For urgent issues, you can contact our support team directly. Remember, your funds are secured by Bitcoin's network, not our service.",
